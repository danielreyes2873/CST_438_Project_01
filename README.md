# CST_438_Project_01: Hyrule Encyclopedia
This Android app is an Encyclopedia of Items found in Hyrule as featured in Breath of the Wild. It will allow users to search for any concept (loot, enemies, weapons, etc.)
that are featured in Breath of the Wild and save them to user profiles. Once saved, users can easily view those concepts any time they wish. It makes use of Android Room to
store user accounts and the data users store. It also makes use of the Retrofit http client to make API calls.
